# Documenting research

* Documentation workflow as a research tool (not just the end product)
* RC as a thinking tool that shapes the research process
* Research workspace, a container of process
* Tracing of the research process
* Represent different phases in the research process

# Collecting 

* Sketching/noodling 
* Quick notes/memos
* Time efficient upload of artistic materials & recordings 
* References management (using bibliographic tools)
* Import from other writing-tools (not just word processors, but also e-learning etc..)

# Structuring

* At most basic: organise materials in categories
* Further enriching: objects with metadata / licenses etc..
* Advanced: express sets, network like relationships, traces, trajectories, 
* Ambiguous / dynamic relations

# Experimenting

* Versioning
* Experiment with different layouts
* Support rewriting
* Have space for comments

# Sharing

* Collaboration 
* Feedback 

# What we do not want to do

* Replace existing research tools
* Add these things as just new features 

# Rather

* Structure expressed using basic web techniques (text, hyperlinks, folders, JSON)
* Put another way: formalize notation within the current format.
* No 'clever' automated stuff (just causes bugs or frustration, we don't have budget to do that well)
