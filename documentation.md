# Documenting research

* Documentation workflow as a research tool (not just the end product)
* RC as a thinking tool 
* Research workspace, a container of process

# Collecting 

* sketching/noodling 
* quick notes/memos
* time efficient upload of artistic materials & recordings 
* references management (using bibliographic tools)
* import from other writing-tools (not just word processors, but also e-learning etc..)

# Structuring

* at most basic: organise materials in categories
* further enriching: objects with metadata / licenses etc..
* advanced: express sets, network like relationships, traces, trajectories, 
* ambigous / dynamic relations

# Experiment

* versioning
* experiment with different layouts
* support rewriting
* have space for comments

# Social

* collaboration 
* feedback 

# what we do not want to do

* Replace exisiting research tools.
* Add these things as just new features 

# Rather

* Structure expressed using basic web techniques (text, hyperlinks, folders, JSON)
* put in another way: formalize notation within the current format.
* No 'clever' automated stuff (just causes bugs or frustration, we don't have budget to do that well)
