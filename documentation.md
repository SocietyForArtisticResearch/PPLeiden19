# documenting research

* Documentation as a research tool (not just the end product)
* RC as a thinking tool / research workspace

# Collecting 

* quick sketching noodling (quick notes/memos)
* time efficient upload of artistic materials & recordings
* references management (using bibliographic tools)
* import from other writing-tools (not just word processor, but also e-learning etc..)

# Structuring

* at most basic: organise materials in categories
* futher enriching: objects with metadata
* advanced organisation express sets, relationships, traces, trajectories, 
* ambigous / dynamic relations

# Experiment

* versioning
* experiment with different layouts
* easy rewriting / changing of metadata
* have space for comments

# Social

* collaboration 
* feedback 

# Export to any format


# what we do not want to do

Replace exisiting research tools.
