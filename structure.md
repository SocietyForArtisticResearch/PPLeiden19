# Structure 

* New format will allow us to express and process structure
* We need to describe structural concepts for exposition
* What is an exposition? 

# Questions

* How to leave space for ambiguity?
* How do want to express structure?
* How do we want to express relationships of objects?
* How do we want to navigate expositions?
* What type of abstractions do we need? 

# A few ideas

* Column, sequence, footnote
* Annotation
* *Paths* through an exposition
* Timeline
* An event based network of triggers
* Define multiple ways of reading, seeing, listening to an exposition
