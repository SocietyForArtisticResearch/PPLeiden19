# Structure 

* New format will allow us to express and process structure
* Not only a technical question but a conceptual one
* We need to define structural concepts 
* What is an exposition? 

# Questions

* How do want to express structure?
* How to leave space for ambiguity?
* How do we want to express relationships of objects?
* How do we want to navigate expositions?
* What type of abstractions do we need? 

# A few ideas

* Columns, sequences, footnotes, main text, headers...
* Annotation
* *Paths* through an exposition
* Timeline
* An event based network of triggers
* Record of a conversation or event 
* Define multiple ways of reading, seeing, listening to an exposition
